To exercise your rights of objection, you may contact us at any time by sending an e-mail to privacy@triggerise.org.

Right to be informed: As a data subject, you have a right to obtain access and information under the conditions provided in Article 15 GDPR. This means that you have the right to obtain confirmation from us as to whether we are processing your personal data. If so, you also have the right to obtain access to the personal data and the information listed in Article 15 (1) GDPR. This includes information regarding the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data that are being processed and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed. Right to erasure / “Right to be forgotten”: As a data subject, you have a right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”) under the conditions provided in Article 17 GDPR. This means that you generally have the right to obtain from us the erasure of your personal data and we are obliged to erase your personal data without undue delay when one of the reasons listed in Article 17 (1) GDPR applies. You can do this by deleting your account at any time. If we have made the personal data public and are obliged to erase it, we are also obliged, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, to take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data that you have requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of those personal data (Article 17 (2) of the GDPR.

The right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”) does not by exception apply if the processing is necessary for one of the reasons listed in Article 17 (3) GDPR. This can be the case, for example, if the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims (Article 17 (3) (b) and (e) GDPR).

Right to restriction of processing: As a data subject, you have a right to restriction of processing under the conditions provided in Article 18 GDPR. This means that you have the right to obtain from us the restriction of processing if one of the conditions provided in Article 18 (1) GDPR applies. This can be the case, for example, if you contest the accuracy of the personal data. In such a case, the restriction of processing lasts for a period that enables us to verify the accuracy of the personal data (Article 18 (1) (a) GDPR). Restriction means that stored personal data are marked with the goal of restricting their future processing (Article 4 No. 3 GDPR).

This means that you generally have the right to receive your personal data with which you have provided us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from us if the processing is based on consent pursuant to Article 6 (1) (a) or Article 9 (2) GDPR or on a contract pursuant to Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR and the processing is carried out by automated means (Article 20 (1) GDPR). In exercising your right to data portability, you also generally have the right to have your personal data transmitted directly from us to another controller if technically feasible (Article 20 (2) GDPR).

Right to Rectification: As a data subject, you have the right to rectification under the conditions provided in Article 16 GDPR. This means in particular that you have the right to receive from us without undue delay the rectification of inaccuracies in your personal data and completion of incomplete personal data.
